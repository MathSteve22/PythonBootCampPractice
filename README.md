# PythonBootCampPractice
This repository is for practicing code as I am learning Python through Udemy's "The Complete Python Bootcamp From Zero to Hero in Python" course.

The organization follows by topic, although this will come later as it is more clear how I can practice.

Future Plans: I also plan on completing Udemy's "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" at a later date, which will be incorporated in this repository.
