# Information Regarding Milestone Projects

Milestone Projects in the "Zero to Hero Python" bootcamp course are projects whose purpose is to incorporate various aspects of the course. Here are the currently uploaded projects. All projects are attempted without the aid of the given workbook, although there are parts of code that may incorporate the workbook.

## Project 1
The first project is an interactive game of tic tac toe. This game does not incorporate any graphics. The given python script does not incorporate the workbook, although the workbook was later used to learn a different way of writing the code. The idea of this project was to get used to using functions.

## Project 2
The second project is an interactive game of BlackJack. As a warmup, the card game of War was also implemented as a python script. The game of War draws heavily from the workbook, but the game of BlackJack pulls less from the workbook. Basically, the purpose of this project is to implement the ideas of object oriented programming with several classes.
